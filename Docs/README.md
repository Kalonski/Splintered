## Splintered
Splintered is a top-down stealth action game that follows a protagonist who the player must control to avoid detection, take down enemies and progress through levels.

This project was built for my A-Level Computer Science coursework before I had learnt to use git/github and so i have retroactively added it to a repository. 
While the code is messy and unorganized I believe it does demonstrate some of my knowledge of OOP and OOP principles, mathematical and algorithmic thinking and my expertise in python as a language.
